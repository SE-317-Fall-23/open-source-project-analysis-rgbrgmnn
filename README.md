Reading open source code is one of the best ways to improve coding skills. Open source projects have to be approachable for a wider audience compared to a software project in a company. Open source projects are reviwed by and developed by more people than closed source project. For these reasons the quality of the code is higher in open source projects. 

In this assignment, you will evaluate the testing approach used in an open-source project. Please select one of the following open-source projects listed below for analysis. If you wish to choose a different project, make sure to obtain prior approval from your instructor.

    -   Description: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, featuring a concise codebase that is valuable for understanding state management testing.

# Instructions:

Select two test cases and describe the test case in Gherkin syntax or your own words (should explain the state, transition and the expected state). Identify the code segments being tested. Enter your answers in the [test case anlaysis](Test-case-analysis.md)
 (2 points)

Address *one* of the following questions in the [second question markdown file](Second-question.md) (1 point):

1.  Describe the types of testing (e.g., unit, integration, UI, or other) used in the project. Explain why you believe these specific types of testing were chosen.
2.  Explain how test data is generated - is it static or dynamic?
3.  Identify which test doubles (e.g., mocks, stubs, fakes) are used in the project.
4.  Investigate discussions in the project regarding testing practices, and provide your interpretation of these discussions in your own words.

# Tips

* Clone the project repo to your comptuer
* Follow the project's instructions to build the project
* Run the project in debugger mode in your IDE
* Select a test, set a breakpoint in the test, run the test and follow the code execution line by line
