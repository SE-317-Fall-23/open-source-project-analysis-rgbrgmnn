## Project Selected: JSHint

## I. Introduction
- Provide an overview of the analysis, indicating the goal of describing the types of testing used in the selected open-source project and explaining the rationale behind their choice.

## II. Types of Testing in the Project
### A. Unit Testing
- Describe the role and purpose of unit testing in the project.
- Identify specific components or modules that are subjected to unit testing.
- Mention how unit tests are executed and the tools or frameworks used.

### B. Integration Testing
- Explain the importance of integration testing in the context of the project.
- Identify the interactions between different modules, services, or components that are tested.
- Highlight the methods used for conducting integration tests and tools employed.

### C. UI (User Interface) Testing
- Describe the significance of UI testing in the project, especially if it's a web application or software with a graphical user interface.
- Explain which aspects of the user interface are tested (e.g., functionality, usability, responsiveness).
- Mention the testing frameworks, tools, or automation scripts used for UI testing.

### D. Other Types of Testing (if applicable)
- If there are additional types of testing beyond unit, integration, and UI testing, outline and briefly explain them.
- Provide insights into why these specific types of testing are relevant to the project's goals.

## III. Reasons for Choosing These Testing Types
- Discuss the rationale behind selecting these particular testing types for the project.
- Consider the project's goals, technology stack, and unique requirements when explaining the choice of testing methods.
- Highlight the benefits and advantages of using these testing types in this context.

## 2. Test Data Generation
### A. Static Test Data
- Explain if and how static test data is used in the project.
- Provide examples of scenarios where static test data is employed.
### B. Dynamic Test Data
- Explain if and how dynamic test data is used in the project.
- Provide examples of scenarios where dynamic test data is generated.

## 3. Test Doubles
- Test doubles are basically placeholder or substitutes used in testing to replace real implementation of a function or module and are extremely useful for isolating a unit of work from the rest of the system. In the two test cases above a Test Double called "Stubs" is used.
- Below are some lines within the two tests functions that use stubs.
- ```JavaScript
  this.sinon.stub(rep, "reporter", function (res) {
      errors = errors.concat(res);
    });
  this.sinon.stub(process, "cwd").returns(dir);
  this.sinon.stub(fsUtils, "readFile")
      .withArgs(sinon.match(/indent\.html$/)).returns(html);
  this.sinon.stub(fsUtils, "exists")
      .withArgs(sinon.match(/indent\.html$/)).returns(true)
      .withArgs(sinon.match(/another\.html$/)).returns(true);
  ```
- Discuss the purpose of using these test doubles in the testing strategy.
- By using stubs, or doubles in general, the tests can focus on the behavior of the unit under test without relying on external dependencies. This ensures that tests can be done in a timely matter and doesn't change any external state of the system. Using stubs also allows for
control over the test environment, such as mocking files that have known errors, as doing so without mocking may cause unexpected behavior on the system.
Thus, using stubs in JSHint allows for developers to have a much more reliable, faster, and focused way of testing command line behavior for JSHint.

## 4. Discussion on Testing Practices
